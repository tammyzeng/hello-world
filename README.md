A reality is only the one you make it. It's all a virtual reality empowered by your mind. Your thoughts are just thoughts but then they tumble into your existing reality and that reality tumbles into something larger that becomes your destiny. Freedom is recognizing your thoughts. Freedom comes in the form of self-awareness.
